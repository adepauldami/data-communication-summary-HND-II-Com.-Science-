# Data Communication Summary (HND-II-Computer Science)

# 1. Data Communications
Data refers to elements of information processing presented in whatever form, and agreed upon by the parties creating and using the data. Communications is the exchange of information agreed upon between two or more points. Telecommunication means communication at a distance. Data communications are the exchange of data between two devices via some form of transmission medium such wire cable. Data communications system em consist consist of communicating devices as a which are made up of a combination of hardware (physical equipment) and software (programs).

Data communications refer to the transfer of data between devices or systems through a transmission medium. It involves sending and receiving information between two or more points. Key characteristics of effective data communication are:

- **Delivery**: Data should be delivered to the intended destination.
- **Accuracy**: Data must be transmitted without errors.

6. **Presentation Layer**: Responsible for data translation, encryption, and compression.
7. **Application Layer**: Provides user-facing services like email, file transfer, and directory services.

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework developed by the International Standards Organization (ISO) to standardize network communication. It divides network communication into seven distinct layers, each with a specific role and set of functions. Here's a detailed explanation of each layer in the OSI model:

### 1. Physical Layer
The physical layer is the lowest level of the OSI model. It deals with the physical connection and transmission of data. Key responsibilities include:

- **Physical Characteristics of Interfaces and Medium**: Defines the hardware specifications for cables, connectors, and electrical signals.
- **Data Rate and Transmission Mode**: Determines the bit rate and whether transmission is simplex (one-way), half-duplex (two-way, but not simultaneous), or full-duplex (two-way and simultaneous).
- **Synchronization of Bits**: Ensures that sender and receiver are aligned for data transmission.
- **Physical Topology**: Describes how devices are physically connected in a network (e.g., star, bus, ring, mesh).
- **Line Configuration**: Defines how devices are linked, whether point-to-point or multipoint.

### 2. Data Link Layer
The data link layer is responsible for ensuring reliable data transfer across a single link or network segment. It focuses on error detection and correction. Main responsibilities include:

- **Framing**: Divides data into manageable units called frames, each with synchronization bits.
- **Physical Addressing**: Adds physical addresses (e.g., MAC addresses) to the frame header to identify the source and destination within the same network.
- **Flow Control**: Manages the data rate to prevent network congestion.
- **Error Control**: Detects and corrects errors in transmission, often using a trailer with error-checking codes.
- **Access Control**: Determines which device can transmit at a given time, especially in shared network environments.

### 3. Network Layer
The network layer manages data routing and addressing across different networks or segments. Key responsibilities include:

- **Logical Addressing**: Uses logical addresses (like IP addresses) to identify devices in a broader network context.
- **Routing**: Determines the best path for data to travel across multiple networks or links.
- **Packet Handling**: Ensures proper delivery of data packets from source to destination, possibly across several networks.

### 4. Transport Layer
The transport layer is responsible for end-to-end communication, ensuring that entire messages are delivered reliably. Its main functions are:

- **Service-Point Addressing**: Uses port numbers to identify specific processes on each host.
- **Segmentation and Reassembly**: Breaks messages into smaller segments for transmission and reassembles them at the destination.
- **Flow Control**: Manages the rate of data transfer to prevent overload.
- **Error Control**: Ensures that messages are delivered without loss or duplication, using mechanisms like acknowledgments and retransmissions.
- **Connection Control**: Can be connection-oriented (establishing a connection before transmission) or connectionless (sending data without a prior connection).

### 5. Session Layer
The session layer establishes, maintains, and synchronizes communication sessions between applications. It has the following responsibilities:

- **Dialog Control**: Manages the flow of communication, allowing for half-duplex or full-duplex operation.
- **Synchronization**: Provides checkpoints or synchronization points for data streams, allowing recovery from errors without re-sending the entire stream.

### 6. Presentation Layer
The presentation layer is responsible for translating data into a format that is understandable by the application layer. Key functions include:

- **Translation**: Converts data between different encoding formats to ensure interoperability.
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Provides security by transforming data for secure transmission.
- **Compression**: Reduces the size of data for efficient transmission.

### 7. Application Layer

- **Mail Services**: Supports email functionality.
- **Directory Services**: Provides a distributed database for managing network information.


## B. TCP/IP Model
The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model consists of four layers:

1. **Host-to-Network Layer**: Equivalent to the OSI physical and data link layers.
2. **Internet Layer**: Comparable to the OSI network layer.
3. **Transport Layer**: Handles transport functions, including connection-oriented and connectionless communication.
4. **Application Layer**: Covers user-level interactions, like web browsing and email, similar to the session, presentation, and application layers in OSI.

The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is a foundational framework for modern network communications, particularly for the internet. It comprises a suite of protocols that define how data is transmitted, routed, and received across networks. Here's a deeper look at TCP/IP, focusing on its structure, core protocols, and key concepts.

### Overview of TCP/IP
TCP/IP is a set of protocols that provide the rules for communication across interconnected networks. It's the basis for data exchange over the internet, ensuring interoperability among different systems and networks. Unlike the OSI model, which has a rigid seven-layer structure, TCP/IP is more flexible and modular, with protocols that can be mixed and matched based on specific needs.

### TCP/IP Layers
TCP/IP consists of four main layers, each with distinct responsibilities:

1. **Network Interface Layer (Link Layer)**
   - This layer corresponds to the OSI physical and data link layers. It handles the physical transmission of data across a network, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and other communication technologies.
   - It manages hardware addressing (like MAC addresses), error detection, and the framing of data for transmission over physical media.

2. **Internet Layer**
   - The internet layer is responsible for routing data packets between networks. It corresponds to the OSI network layer.
   - **Internet Protocol (IP)** is the core protocol of this layer. It handles logical addressing using IP addresses, ensuring that data is sent to the correct destination.
   - Other key protocols in this layer include **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)** for error reporting and diagnostics, and **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)** for mapping IP addresses to hardware addresses.

3. **Transport Layer**
   - The transport layer manages end-to-end communication between applications on different devices. It aligns with the OSI transport layer.
   - **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** provides reliable, connection-oriented communication. It ensures data is delivered without loss or duplication, using error control, flow control, and acknowledgments.
   - **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)** is a connectionless protocol, offering faster, but less reliable, data transmission. It's used in applications where low latency is crucial, like streaming and gaming.
   - **Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)** is another transport protocol that combines features of both TCP and UDP, providing reliable and message-oriented communication.

4. **Application Layer**
   - The application layer is the topmost layer, providing network services directly to end-users and applications. It encompasses the OSI session, presentation, and application layers.
   - This layer includes a wide range of protocols for specific services, such as:
     - **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** for web communication.
     - **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)** for file transfer.
     - **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)** for email.
     - **Domain Name System (DNS)** for domain name resolution.

### Key Concepts in TCP/IP
- **Interoperability**: TCP/IP is designed to work across different networks and hardware platforms, allowing seamless communication.
- **Hierarchical Structure**: While each layer has specific responsibilities, there's a degree of flexibility in how protocols interact, allowing for a robust and scalable communication system.
- **Reliability and Connection Management**: TCP provides mechanisms for ensuring reliable data transmission, including acknowledgments, retransmissions, and flow control.
- **Flexibility and Scalability**: TCP/IP can adapt to various networking environments, from small-scale local networks to the global internet.

### Pros of TCP/IP
- **Interoperability**: TCP/IP allows devices from different manufacturers and with different operating systems to communicate, making it the standard for global network communication.
- **Scalability**: TCP/IP supports both small-scale networks and large-scale networks, including the entire internet, allowing for significant growth without major reconfiguration.
- **Flexibility**: The TCP/IP suite provides a range of protocols for various tasks, such as HTTP for web browsing, SMTP for email, and FTP for file transfer, enabling diverse applications.
- **Reliability**: TCP, a core component of the suite, provides mechanisms for reliable communication, including error detection, retransmission, and flow control.
- **Modularity**: With a clear division of tasks among layers, TCP/IP is modular, allowing for changes and upgrades without affecting the entire system.

### Cons of TCP/IP
- **Security Risks**: TCP/IP's widespread use makes it a target for cyberattacks, and it requires additional security measures like firewalls and encryption to protect data.
- **Complexity**: The flexibility and variety of protocols in TCP/IP can make it complex to understand and configure, especially for those new to networking.
- **Lack of Clear Layer Boundaries**: While the OSI model has a rigid seven-layer structure, TCP/IP’s layers are less defined, which can lead to confusion about where specific functions belong.
- **Limited Built-In Error Handling**: While TCP provides reliability, not all TCP/IP protocols offer built-in error handling, requiring additional measures for some use cases.

### Similarities between TCP/IP and OSI
- **Layered Architecture**: Both TCP/IP and OSI use a layered structure to separate network functions and responsibilities, promoting modularity.
- **Transport Layer Functions**: Both models have a transport layer responsible for end-to-end communication, including flow control and error control.
- **Application Layer Functions**: Both models include an application layer providing end-user services like email and file transfer.

### Differences between TCP/IP and OSI
- **Number of Layers**: TCP/IP has four layers (Network Interface, Internet, Transport, and Application), while OSI has seven (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application).
- **Approach**: TCP/IP was developed from practical implementation and real-world use, while OSI was designed as a theoretical model with a more rigid structure.
- **Scope**: TCP/IP has a broader and more flexible approach to networking, allowing various protocols to be used within its layers, while OSI has a more standardized structure with defined roles for each layer.

# Routing in Wide Area Networks (WAN)
Routing in WANs involves finding efficient paths for packets to travel from source to destination. Due to large distances and a high number of hosts, direct communication (as in Local Area Networks or LANs) is not feasible. Therefore, routing relies on intermediate nodes to forward packets selectively. This process can use static, dynamic, or distributed routing methods.

- **Static Routing**: Uses predefined paths for packet delivery. If there's a network failure, static routing doesn't adapt, potentially causing delays or data loss.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Also known as adaptive routing, it adjusts paths based on current network conditions. This method allows rerouting around damaged or congested areas.
- **Distributed Routing**: Distributes routing computation among network nodes, allowing for dynamic adaptation to changing network topologies.

### Internet Protocol (IP)
Internet Protocol (IP) is a network layer protocol responsible for packet addressing and routing. It consists of two main versions:

- **IPv4**: The traditional IP version with 32-bit addresses. It supports fragmentation and reassembly, logical addressing, and routing.
- **IPv6**: The next-generation IP version with 128-bit addresses. It provides a larger address space, better security, improved header structure, and support for resource allocation.

### IP Packet Format
An IP packet, also known as a datagram, has a header and data sections. Here's a summary of the key fields in the IP header:

1. **Version**: Specifies the IP version (e.g., 4 for IPv4).
2. **Header Length**: Indicates the length of the IP header.
3. **Total Length**: Specifies the total length of the datagram.
4. **Identification, Flags, Fragment Offset**: Used for fragmentation and reassembly of packets.
5. **Time to Live (TTL)**: Determines how long a packet can exist before being discarded.
6. **Protocol**: Indicates which upper-layer protocol (e.g., TCP or UDP) is used.
7. **Header Checksum**: Ensures the integrity of the header.
8. **Source and Destination IP Addresses**: The starting point and final destination of the packet.

### IPv6
IPv6 introduces new features to address the limitations of IPv4:

- **Larger Address Space**: IPv6 has 128-bit addresses, providing a much larger address space than IPv4's 32-bit addresses.
- **Separate Options Field**: Improves routing by moving options out of the base header.
- **Flow Label**: Supports real-time traffic.
- **Enhanced Security**: Offers encryption and decryption options for greater security.
- **Priority Field**: Specifies the priority of packets for traffic management.

### Advantages of IPv6
- **Expanded Address Space**: 128-bit addresses allow for a vastly increased number of unique addresses.
- **Improved Header Structure**: Separating the options field from the base header streamlines routing.
- **Support for Security**: Inbuilt encryption and decryption for improved packet security.
- **Resource Allocation**: Flow label field supports real-time audio and video traffic.

### Routing Policies
Routing protocols and policies govern how packets are directed through networks:

- **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)**: Sends error messages and operational information between network devices.
- **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**: Automates IP address assignment in a client-server architecture.
- **Network Address Translation (NAT)**: Allows one public IP address to represent a group of private addresses, commonly used for routing private networks to the internet.
- **Routing Information Protocol (RIP)**: Routes packets based on the number of hops. RIPv1 uses broadcasts, while RIPv2 uses multicasts and supports security features like authentication.
- **Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP)**: Developed by Cisco, it allows for up to 100 hops and incorporates metrics like network capacity, reliability, and load.
- **Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)**: Cisco's extension to IGRP, supporting up to 255 hops and featuring reliable transport and fast data convergence.
- **Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)**: Uses the shortest path first (SPF) algorithm to ensure efficient transmission of data. It maintains topology tables with link state advertisements.
- **Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP)**: Exchanges data between autonomous systems, using recognized routers and routing tables to find optimal paths.
- **Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)**: An exterior gateway protocol that uses a best path selection algorithm, considering factors like path length, router identification, and neighbor IP addresses.
- **Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS)**: An interior gateway protocol that uses a version of the Dijkstra algorithm for sharing IP routing information. It organizes routers into groups to create larger domains.

# Data Link Layer Services
The data link layer provides several services to ensure smooth data transmission:

- **Framing**: Divides packets into frames to differentiate them from each other. Fixed-size framing uses a consistent frame size, while variable-size framing requires delimiters to indicate the start and end of frames.
- **Flow and Error Control**: Regulates the data transmission rate to avoid overwhelming the receiver. Common techniques include Stop-and-Wait and Sliding Window.
- **Multiple Access Control**: Ensures efficient use of shared media, preventing collisions and managing crosstalk. This can be achieved through various protocols like ALOHA, CSMA, CSMA/CD, and CSMA/CA.


Here's a more focused breakdown of Data Link Layer Services and related topics without network topology and application layer.

### Data Link Layer Services

The data link layer (Layer 2) in the OSI model provides services that enable reliable data communication between devices on the same network or local segment. It handles framing, flow control, error control, and media access control. This layer ensures that packets are framed for reliable communication, data is delivered error-free, and collisions are managed in shared networks.

#### Framing
Framing involves encapsulating data into frames that are distinguishable from one another, similar to putting a letter into an envelope. The framing process ensures that each data unit can be separated from the next, allowing efficient data transmission. Framing adds sender and destination addresses to identify the source and intended recipient, enabling correct routing.

- **Problems in Framing**:
  - **Detecting the Start of the Frame**: Frames typically start with a specific sequence of bits known as the Starting Frame Delimiter (SFD).
  - **Detecting the End of the Frame**: This indicates where one frame ends and the next begins.
  - **Distinguishing Frames**: Ensuring that a unique identifier or pattern marks the start and end of each frame.

#### Flow Control
Flow control manages the rate of data transmission to prevent overwhelming the receiving device. Techniques like Stop-and-Wait and Sliding Window ensure that data is sent at a rate that the receiver can handle.

- **Stop-and-Wait**: The sender sends one frame and waits for an acknowledgment before sending the next. This approach is simple but can be inefficient.
- **Sliding Window**: Allows multiple frames to be sent before requiring acknowledgment, improving efficiency while managing the flow of data.

#### Error Control
Error control involves mechanisms for error detection and correction. The data link layer ensures that frames with errors are detected and retransmitted if needed. Common techniques include checksums, parity bits, and cyclic redundancy checks (CRC).

- **Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)**: An error control technique where the receiver requests retransmission of lost or corrupted frames. It includes Stop-and-Wait ARQ and Sliding Window ARQ.

#### Media Access Control
Media access control (MAC) manages how multiple devices share the same transmission medium. It determines which device has control of the medium at any given time, preventing data collisions and ensuring fair access.

- **Random Access Protocols**:
  - **ALOHA**: Allows devices to transmit data at will, but collisions can occur if multiple devices send data simultaneously.
  - **Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)**: Devices sense the medium before transmitting, reducing collisions.
  - **CSMA with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)**: Devices detect collisions and take corrective action, common in Ethernet networks.
  - **CSMA with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)**: Devices avoid collisions by waiting for an idle medium, common in wireless networks.

- **Controlled Access Protocols**:
  - **Token Passing**: Devices take turns accessing the medium using a token.
  - **Polling**: A central controller grants permission to transmit.

- **Channelization**:
  - **Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)**: Divides bandwidth into multiple frequency bands for different devices.
  - **Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)**: Divides bandwidth into time slots for different devices.
  - **Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)**: Allows multiple devices to share the same frequency by encoding signals with unique codes.

### Congestion Control Algorithms
Congestion control helps manage network load and ensure efficient data transmission:

- **Leaky Bucket Algorithm**: Controls the rate at which packets enter the network. Regardless of the packet inflow rate, the outflow rate is constant, preventing bursts and reducing congestion.
- **Token Bucket Algorithm**: Introduces flexibility by allowing bursts of packets when tokens are available. This provides some adaptability compared to the Leaky Bucket Algorithm.

### Futher explanation:

### Fragmentation and Reassembly
IP fragmentation occurs when a datagram is too large for the network's MTU. The larger datagram is split into smaller fragments, each with its own IP header. These fragments are reassembled at the destination. This process allows IP to work across different network types with varying MTUs.

### Leaky Bucket Algorithm
The Leaky Bucket algorithm is a simple yet effective mechanism for controlling network traffic and ensuring consistent data flow. It aims to regulate the rate at which packets are introduced into the network, preventing bursts that could lead to congestion.

Here's how the Leaky Bucket algorithm works:

1. **Bucket Representation**: The "bucket" represents a queue or buffer holding incoming packets.
2. **Leak Rate**: The rate at which packets "leak" from the bucket is constant, regardless of the input rate.
3. **Input Packets**: Packets are added to the bucket as they arrive.
4. **Overflow Handling**: If the bucket overflows, any additional incoming packets are discarded or queued elsewhere, leading to packet loss or delays.
5. **Consistent Output Rate**: The outflow rate is constant, ensuring a steady stream of packets to the network.

The Leaky Bucket algorithm is often used to enforce traffic shaping, smoothing out traffic bursts, and preventing network congestion.

### Token Bucket Algorithm
The Token Bucket algorithm provides a more flexible approach to traffic shaping and congestion control, allowing for bursty traffic patterns while maintaining a controlled output rate. Unlike the Leaky Bucket, the Token Bucket algorithm allows packets to be sent at a faster rate if tokens are available.

Here's how the Token Bucket algorithm works:

1. **Tokens**: The "bucket" in this context contains tokens. Tokens represent permission to send a packet.
2. **Token Generation**: Tokens are added to the bucket at a constant rate, up to a maximum capacity.
3. **Sending Packets**: To send a packet, a token must be consumed from the bucket. If no tokens are available, the packet must wait until more tokens are generated.
4. **Bursts**: Because tokens can accumulate in the bucket, bursty traffic is allowed as long as there are sufficient tokens.
5. **Controlled Output Rate**: Although bursts are allowed, the token generation rate controls the long-term output rate, providing a mechanism to prevent overloading the network.

### Comparing Leaky Bucket and Token Bucket
The Leaky Bucket algorithm ensures a consistent output rate by strictly controlling how packets leave the queue. This is useful for traffic shaping and preventing network congestion due to bursty traffic. However, it lacks flexibility when bursty traffic is desired.

The Token Bucket algorithm provides flexibility by allowing bursts while still controlling the long-term output rate through token generation. This is beneficial for applications requiring occasional bursts of traffic, like real-time multimedia streaming or batch data transfers, while maintaining a stable network load.


- **Queuing Disciplines**:
  - **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)**: Packets are processed in the order they arrive.
  - **Priority Queuing**: Assigns different priorities to packets, processing high-priority packets first.
  - **Fair Queuing**: Ensures each flow gets a fair share of bandwidth.
  - **Weighted Fair Queuing**: Allocates bandwidth based on predetermined weights, allowing fine-tuning of resource allocation.

### Note:
The data link layer plays a crucial role in managing data transmission, ensuring reliability, controlling errors, and mediating access to the communication medium. Framing, flow control, error control, and media access control are essential components of this layer. Congestion control and resource allocation help maintain efficient and reliable network performance by managing data flow and preventing network overload.


# Network Security
